      "[Document(id_='26513034', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras\\' theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry between the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.\\nThe theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and the hypotenuse c, sometimes called the Pythagorean equation:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nThe theorem is named for the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC.  The theorem has been proved numerous times by many different methods – possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. The proofs are diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years.\\nWhen Euclidean space is represented by a Cartesian coordinate system in analytic geometry, Euclidean distance satisfies the Pythagorean relation: the squared distance between two points equals the sum of squares of the difference in each coordinate between the points.\\nThe theorem can be generalized in various ways: to higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and to objects that are not triangles at all but n-dimensional solids.\\n\\n\\n== Proofs using constructed squares ==\\n\\n\\n=== Rearrangement proofs ===\\nIn one rearrangement proof, two squares are used whose sides have a measure of  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        +\\n        b\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a+b}\\n  \\n  and which contain four right triangles whose sides are a, b and c, with the hypotenuse being c.  In the square on the right side, the triangles are placed such that the corners of the square correspond to the corners of the right angle in the triangles, forming a square in the center whose sides are length c.  Each outer square has an area of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        (\\n        a\\n        +\\n        b\\n        \\n          )\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}}\\n  \\n  as well as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        +\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 2ab+c^{2}}\\n  \\n, with \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 2ab}\\n  \\n representing the total area of the four triangles.  Within the big square on the left side, the four triangles are moved to form two similar rectangles with sides of length a and b.  These rectangles in their new position have now delineated two new squares, one having side length a is formed in the bottom-left corner, and another square of side length b formed in the top-right corner.  In this new position, this left side now has a square of area  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        (\\n        a\\n        +\\n        b\\n        \\n          )\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}}\\n  \\n  as well as  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        +\\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}}\\n  \\n.

In this way they also form two boxes, this time in consecutive corners, with areas  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a^{2}}\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle b^{2}}\\n  \\nwhich will again lead to a second square of with the area \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        +\\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}}\\n  \\n.\\nEnglish mathematician Sir Thomas Heath gives this proof in his commentary on Proposition I.47 in Euclid\\'s Elements, and mentions the proposals of German mathematicians Carl Anton Bretschneider and Hermann Hankel that Pythagoras may have known this proof.  Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion \"that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him.\"  Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues.\\n\\n\\n=== Algebraic proofs ===\\n\\nThe theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side c, as shown in the lower part of the diagram. This results in a larger square, with side a + b and area (a + b)2. The four triangles and the square side c must have the same area as the larger square,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        (\\n        b\\n        +\\n        a\\n        \\n          )\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        4\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              a\\n              b\\n            \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle (b+a)^{2}=c^{2}+4{\\\\frac {ab}{2}}=c^{2}+2ab,}\\n  \\n\\ngiving\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        (\\n        b\\n        +\\n        a\\n        \\n          )\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        −\\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        =\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        +\\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        −\\n        2\\n        a\\n        b\\n        =\\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c^{2}=(b+a)^{2}-2ab=b^{2}+2ab+a^{2}-2ab=a^{2}+b^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nA similar proof uses four copies of a right triangle with sides a, b and c, arranged inside a square with side c as in the top half of the diagram.

Draw the altitude from point C, and call H its intersection with the side AB. Point H divides the length of the hypotenuse c into parts d and e. The new triangle, ACH, is similar to triangle ABC, because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at A, meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as θ in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle CBH is also similar to ABC. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the triangle postulate: The sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the parallel postulate. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              B\\n              C\\n            \\n            \\n              A\\n              B\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              B\\n              H\\n            \\n            \\n              B\\n              C\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n           and \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              A\\n              C\\n            \\n            \\n              A\\n              B\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              A\\n              H\\n            \\n            \\n              A\\n              C\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {BC}{AB}}={\\\\frac {BH}{BC}}{\\\\text{ and }}{\\\\frac {AC}{AB}}={\\\\frac {AH}{AC}}.}\\n  \\n\\nThe first result equates the cosines of the angles θ, whereas the second result equates their sines.\\nThese ratios can be written as\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        B\\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        A\\n        B\\n        ×\\n        B\\n        H\\n        \\n           and \\n        \\n        A\\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        A\\n        B\\n        ×\\n        A\\n        H\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle BC^{2}=AB\\\\times BH{\\\\text{ and }}AC^{2}=AB\\\\times AH.}\\n  \\n\\nSumming these two equalities results in\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        B\\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        A\\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        A\\n        B\\n        ×\\n        B\\n        H\\n        +\\n        A\\n        B\\n        ×\\n        A\\n        H\\n        =\\n        A\\n        B\\n        (\\n        A\\n        H\\n        +\\n        B\\n        H\\n        )\\n        =\\n        A\\n        \\n          B\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB\\\\times BH+AB\\\\times AH=AB(AH+BH)=AB^{2},}\\n  \\n\\nwhich, after simplification, demonstrates the Pythagorean theorem:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        B\\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        A\\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        A\\n        \\n          B\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nThe role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the Elements, and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.\\n\\n\\n=== Einstein\\'s proof by dissection without rearrangement ===\\n\\nAlbert Einstein gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces do not need to be moved. Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two similar shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see Similar figures on the three sides).  In Einstein\\'s proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.  Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle.  Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.\\n\\n\\n=== Euclid\\'s proof ===\\n\\nIn outline, here is how the proof in Euclid\\'s Elements proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be congruent, proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.\\nLet A, B, C be the vertices of a right triangle, with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.\\nFor the formal proof, we require four elementary lemmata:\\n\\nIf two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent (side-angle-side).\\nThe area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.\\nThe area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.\\nThe area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).\\nNext, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.\\n\\nThe proof is as follows:\\n\\nLet ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.\\nOn each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.\\nFrom A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.\\nJoin CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.\\nAngles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are collinear.\\nAngles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.\\nSince AB is equal to FB, BD is equal to BC and angle ABD equals angle FBC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC.\\nSince A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2)\\nSince C is collinear with A and G, and this line is parallel to FB, then square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC.\\nTherefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB2.\\nBy applying steps 3 to 10 to the other side of the figure, it can be similarly shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC2.\\nAdding these two results, AB2 + AC2 = BD × BK + KL × KC\\nSince BD = KL, BD × BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC\\nTherefore, AB2 + AC2 = BC2, since CBDE is a square.\\nThis proof, which appears in Euclid\\'s Elements as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1, demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares.\\nThis is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used.\\n\\n\\n=== Proofs by dissection and rearrangement ===\\nAnother by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area c2, from four identical right triangles with sides a, b and c, fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2, which must have the same area as the initial large square.\\nThe third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called dissection. This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones.\\n\\n\\n=== Proof by area-preserving shearing ===\\n\\nAs shown in the accompanying animation, area-preserving shear mappings and translations can transform the squares on the sides adjacent to the right-angle onto the square on the hypotenuse, together covering it exactly. Each shear leaves the base and height unchanged, thus leaving the area unchanged too. The translations also leave the area unchanged, as they do not alter the shapes at all. Each square is first sheared into a parallelogram, and then into a rectangle which can be translated onto one section of the square on the hypotenuse.\\n\\n\\n=== Other algebraic proofs ===\\nA related proof was published by future U.S. President James A. Garfield (then a U.S. Representative) (see diagram). Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid, which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square, to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram. The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        b\\n        +\\n        a\\n        \\n          )\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {1}{2}}(b+a)^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nThe inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {1}{2}}}\\n  \\n, which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result.\\n\\n\\n=== Proof using differentials ===\\nOne can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing calculus.\\nThe triangle ABC is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with BC the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length y, the side AC of length x and the side AB of length a, as seen in the lower diagram part.\\n\\nIf x is increased by a small amount dx by extending the side AC slightly to D, then y also increases by dy. These form two sides of a triangle, CDE, which (with E chosen so CE is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to ABC. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              d\\n              y\\n            \\n            \\n              d\\n              x\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n            y\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {dy}{dx}}={\\\\frac {x}{y}}.}\\n  \\n\\nThis can be rewritten as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n        \\n        d\\n        y\\n        =\\n        x\\n        \\n        d\\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y\\\\,dy=x\\\\,dx}\\n  \\n , which is a differential equation that can be solved by direct integration:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∫\\n        y\\n        \\n        d\\n        y\\n        =\\n        ∫\\n        x\\n        \\n        d\\n        x\\n        \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\int y\\\\,dy=\\\\int x\\\\,dx\\\\,,}\\n  \\n\\ngiving\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        C\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+C.}\\n  \\n\\nThe constant can be deduced from x = 0, y = a to give the equation\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+a^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nThis is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of dx and dy.\\n\\n\\n== Converse ==\\nThe converse of the theorem is also true:\\n\\nGiven a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, if a2 + b2 = c2, then the angle between sides a and b is a right angle.\\nFor any three positive real numbers a, b, and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle with sides a, b and c as a consequence of the converse of the triangle inequality.\\nThis converse appears in Euclid\\'s Elements (Book I, Proposition 48):  \"If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.\"\\nIt can be proved using the law of cosines or as follows:\\nLet ABC be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, with a2 + b2 = c2. Construct a second triangle with sides of length a and b containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length c = √a2 + b2, the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles\\' sides are the same lengths a, b and c, the triangles are congruent and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths a and b in the original triangle is a right angle.\\nThe above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proved without assuming the Pythagorean theorem.\\nA corollary of the Pythagorean theorem\\'s converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let c be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and a + b > c (otherwise there is no triangle according to the triangle inequality). The following statements apply:\\n\\nIf a2 + b2 = c2, then the triangle is right.\\nIf a2 + b2 > c2, then the triangle is acute.\\nIf a2 + b2 < c2, then the triangle is obtuse.\\nEdsger W. Dijkstra has stated this proposition about acute, right, and obtuse triangles in this language:\\n\\nsgn(α + β − γ) = sgn(a2 + b2 − c2),\\nwhere α is the angle opposite to side a, β is the angle opposite to side b, γ is the angle opposite to side c, and sgn is the sign function.\\n\\n\\n== Consequences and uses of the theorem ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pythagorean triples ===\\n\\nA Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a2 + b2 = c2. In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c). Some well-known examples are (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13).\\nA primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime (the greatest common divisor of a, b and c is 1).\\nThe following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100:\\n\\n(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97)\\n\\n\\n=== Inverse Pythagorean theorem ===\\nGiven a right triangle with sides \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        ,\\n        b\\n        ,\\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a,b,c}\\n  \\n and altitude \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        d\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle d}\\n  \\n (a line from the right angle and perpendicular to the hypotenuse \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c}\\n  \\n).

Pythagoras\\' theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the square root operation.\\nThe figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer. Each triangle has a side (labeled \"1\") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras\\' theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as √2, √3, √5 . For more detail, see Quadratic irrational.\\nIncommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school\\'s concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit. According to one legend, Hippasus of Metapontum (ca. 470 B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable.\\nA careful discussion of Hippasus\\'s contributions is found in Fritz.\\n\\n\\n=== Complex numbers ===\\n\\nFor any complex number\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        z\\n        =\\n        x\\n        +\\n        i\\n        y\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle z=x+iy,}\\n  \\n\\nthe absolute value or modulus is given by\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        r\\n        =\\n        \\n          |\\n        \\n        z\\n        \\n          |\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              x\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            \\n              y\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle r=|z|={\\\\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}\\n  \\n\\nSo the three quantities, r, x and y are related by the Pythagorean equation,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          r\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nNote that r is defined to be a positive number or zero but x and y can be negative as well as positive.

coordinates are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if curvilinear coordinates are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the applications of Legendre polynomials in physics. The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras\\' theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates (r, θ) can be introduced as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        =\\n        r\\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        θ\\n        ,\\n         \\n

That is, Euclid\\'s fifth postulate implies the Pythagorean theorem and vice-versa.\\n\\n\\n== Generalizations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Similar figures on the three sides ===\\nThe Pythagorean theorem generalizes beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to  any similar figures. This was known by Hippocrates of Chios in the 5th century BC, and was included by Euclid in his Elements:\\n\\nIf one erects similar figures (see Euclidean geometry) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.\\nThis extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are a:b:c). While Euclid\\'s proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure\\'s boundary being the side of the original triangle).\\nThe basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas A, B and C are erected on sides with corresponding lengths a, b and c then:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            A\\n            \\n              a\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            B\\n            \\n              b\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            C\\n            \\n              c\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {A}{a^{2}}}={\\\\frac {B}{b^{2}}}={\\\\frac {C}{c^{2}}}\\\\,,}\\n  \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ⇒\\n        A\\n        +\\n        B\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              a\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n            \\n              c\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        C\\n        +\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              b\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n            \\n              c\\n              \\n                2\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        C\\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Rightarrow A+B={\\\\frac {a^{2}}{c^{2}}}C+{\\\\frac {b^{2}}{c^{2}}}C\\\\,.}\\n  \\n\\nBut, by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, so A + B = C.\\nConversely, if we can prove that A + B = C for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle C on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (A and B ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its altitude. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus A + B = C and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a2 + b2 = c2.

Suppose the selected angle θ is opposite the side labeled c. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle CAD with angle θ opposite side b and with side r along c. A second triangle is formed with angle θ opposite side a and a side with length s along c, as shown in the figure. Thābit ibn Qurra stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        c\\n        (\\n        r\\n        +\\n        s\\n        )\\n         \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c(r+s)\\\\ .}\\n  \\n\\nAs the angle θ approaches π/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths r and s overlap less and less. When θ = π/2, ADB becomes a right triangle, r + s = c, and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained.\\nOne proof observes that triangle ABC has the same angles as triangle CAD, but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex A, both contain the angle θ, and so also have the same third angle by the triangle postulate.) Consequently, ABC is similar to the reflection of CAD, the triangle DAC in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            c\\n            b\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            b\\n            r\\n          \\n        \\n         \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {c}{b}}={\\\\frac {b}{r}}\\\\ .}\\n  \\n\\nLikewise, for the reflection of the other triangle,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            c\\n            a\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            a\\n            s\\n          \\n        \\n         \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {c}{a}}={\\\\frac {a}{s}}\\\\ .}\\n  \\n\\nClearing fractions and adding these two relations:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        c\\n        s\\n        +\\n        c\\n        r\\n        =\\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n         \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle cs+cr=a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\ ,}\\n  \\n\\nthe required result.\\nThe theorem remains valid if the angle \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        θ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\theta }\\n  \\n is obtuse so the lengths r and s are non-overlapping.\\n\\n\\n=== General triangles using parallelograms ===\\n\\nPappus\\'s area theorem is a further generalization, that applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares (squares are a special case, of course). The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras\\' theorem, and was considered a generalization by Pappus of Alexandria in 4 AD\\nThe lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base b and height h. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms.\\n\\n\\n=== Solid geometry ===\\n\\nIn terms of solid geometry, Pythagoras\\' theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. Consider the cuboid shown in the figure. The length of face diagonal AC is found from Pythagoras\\' theorem as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                A\\n                C\\n              \\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                A\\n                B\\n              \\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                B\\n                C\\n              \\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\overline {AC}}^{\\\\,2}={\\\\overline {AB}}^{\\\\,2}+{\\\\overline {BC}}^{\\\\,2}\\\\,,}\\n  \\n\\nwhere these three sides form a right triangle.

However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras\\' theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.\\nA substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is de Gua\\'s theorem, named for Jean Paul de Gua de Malves: If a tetrahedron has a right angle corner (like a corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the \"n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem\":\\n\\nLet \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        …\\n        ,\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\\\ldots ,x_{n}}\\n  \\n be orthogonal vectors in Rn.

Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of S is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the n legs.\\nThis statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The \"hypotenuse\" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the \"legs\" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the \"legs\" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras\\' theorem applies. In a different wording:\\n\\nGiven an n-rectangular n-dimensional simplex, the square of the (n − 1)-content of the facet opposing the right vertex will equal the sum of the squares of the (n − 1)-contents of the remaining facets.\\n\\n\\n=== Inner product spaces ===\\n\\nThe Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to inner product spaces, which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces. For example, a function may be considered as a vector with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in functional analysis.\\nIn an inner product space, the concept of perpendicularity is replaced by the concept of orthogonality: two vectors v and w are orthogonal if their inner product \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ⟨\\n        \\n          v\\n        \\n        ,\\n        \\n          w\\n        \\n        ⟩\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\langle \\\\mathbf {v} ,\\\\mathbf {w} \\\\rangle }\\n  \\n is zero. The inner product is a generalization of the dot product of vectors. The dot product is called the standard inner product or the Euclidean inner product. However, other inner products are possible.\\nThe concept of length is replaced by the concept of the norm ‖v‖ of a vector v, defined as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ‖\\n        \\n          v\\n        \\n        ‖\\n        ≡\\n        \\n          \\n            ⟨\\n            \\n              v\\n            \\n            ,\\n            \\n              v\\n            \\n            ⟩\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\lVert \\\\mathbf {v} \\\\rVert \\\\equiv {\\\\sqrt {\\\\langle \\\\mathbf {v} ,\\\\mathbf {v} \\\\rangle }}\\\\,.}\\n  \\n\\nIn an inner-product space, the Pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors v and w we have\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            ‖\\n            \\n              \\n                v\\n              \\n              +\\n              \\n                w\\n              \\n            \\n            ‖\\n          \\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            ‖\\n            \\n              v\\n            \\n            ‖\\n          \\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          \\n            ‖\\n            \\n              w\\n            \\n            ‖\\n          \\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\left\\\\|\\\\mathbf {v} +\\\\mathbf {w} \\\\right\\\\|^{2}=\\\\left\\\\|\\\\mathbf {v} \\\\right\\\\|^{2}+\\\\left\\\\|\\\\mathbf {w} \\\\right\\\\|^{2}.}\\n  \\n\\nHere the vectors v and w are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the vector sum v + w.

More precisely, the Pythagorean theorem implies, and is implied by, Euclid\\'s Parallel (Fifth) Postulate. Thus, right triangles in a non-Euclidean geometry\\ndo not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in spherical geometry, all three sides of the right triangle (say a, b, and c) bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to π/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          b\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        2\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        >\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=2c^{2}>c^{2}}\\n  \\n.\\nHere two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered—spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines.\\nHowever, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say A+B = C. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters a and b equals the area of the circle with diameter c.\\n\\n\\n==== Spherical geometry ====\\n\\nFor any right triangle on a sphere of radius R (for example, if γ in the figure is a right angle), with sides a, b, c, the relation between the sides takes the form:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            c\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            a\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            b\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\cos {\\\\frac {c}{R}}=\\\\cos {\\\\frac {a}{R}}\\\\,\\\\cos {\\\\frac {b}{R}}.}\\n  \\n\\nThis equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines that applies to all spherical triangles:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            c\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            a\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            b\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        sin\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            a\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        sin\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            b\\n            R\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        cos\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          γ\\n        \\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\cos {\\\\frac {c}{R}}=\\\\cos {\\\\frac {a}{R}}\\\\,\\\\cos {\\\\frac {b}{R}}+\\\\sin {\\\\frac {a}{R}}\\\\,\\\\sin {\\\\frac {b}{R}}\\\\,\\\\cos {\\\\gamma }.}\\n  \\n\\nFor infinitesimal triangles on the sphere (or equivalently, for finite spherical triangles on a sphere of infinite radius), the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle reduces to the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. To see how, assume we have a spherical triangle of fixed side lengths a, b, and c on a sphere with expanding radius R.

Historians of Mesopotamian mathematics have concluded that the Pythagorean rule was in widespread use during the Old Babylonian period (20th to 16th centuries BC), over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born. The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system.\\nWritten c. 1800 BC, the Egyptian Middle Kingdom Berlin Papyrus 6619 includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet Plimpton 322, written near Larsa also c. 1800 BC, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.\\nIn India, the Baudhayana Shulba Sutra, the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples and a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, both in the special case of the isosceles right triangle and in the general case, as does the Apastamba Shulba Sutra (c.\\u2009600 BC).\\nByzantine Neoplatonic philosopher and mathematician Proclus, writing in the fifth century AD, states two arithmetic rules, \"one of them attributed to Plato, the other to Pythagoras\", for generating special Pythagorean triples.  The rule attributed to Pythagoras (c.\\u2009570 – c.\\u2009495 BC) starts from an odd number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by one unit; the rule attributed to Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) starts from an even number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by two units. According to Thomas L. Heath (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted. Classicist Kurt von Fritz wrote, \"Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally ... one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics.\" Around 300 BC, in Euclid\\'s Elements, the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented.\\n\\nWith contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the Chinese text Zhoubi Suanjing (周髀算经), (The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven) gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle — in China it is called the \"Gougu theorem\" (勾股定理). During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, together with a mention of right triangles. Some believe the theorem arose first in China in the 11th century BC, where it is alternatively known as the \"Shang Gao theorem\" (商高定理), named after the Duke of Zhou\\'s astronomer and mathematician, whose reasoning composed most of what was in the Zhoubi Suanjing.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== References ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPythagorean theorem at ProofWiki\\n\\nEuclid (1997) [c. 300 BC].

General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential equations.\\nNewton\\'s law of universal gravitation, which describes classical gravity, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions. Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation in classical physics. These predictions concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light, and include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay and singularities/black holes. So far, all tests of general relativity have been shown to be in agreement with the theory. The time-dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation. Despite the introduction of a number of alternative theories, general relativity continues to be the simplest theory consistent with experimental data.\\nReconciliation of general relativity with the laws of quantum physics remains a problem, however, as there is a lack of a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. It is not yet known how gravity can be unified with the three non-gravitational forces: strong, weak and electromagnetic.\\nEinstein\\'s theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon. Other predictions include the existence of gravitational waves, which have been observed directly by the physics collaboration LIGO and other observatories. In addition, general relativity has provided the base of cosmological models of an expanding universe.\\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nHenri Poincaré\\'s 1905 theory of the dynamics of the electron was a relativistic theory which he applied to all forces, including gravity.  While others thought that gravity was instantaneous or of electromagnetic origin, he suggested that relativity was \"something due to our methods of measurement\". In his theory, he showed that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. Soon afterwards, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall (FFO), he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations, which form the core of Einstein\\'s general theory of relativity. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present. A version of non-Euclidean geometry, called Riemannian geometry, enabled Einstein to develop general relativity by providing the key mathematical framework on which he fit his physical ideas of gravity. This idea was pointed out by mathematician Marcel Grossmann and published by Grossmann and Einstein in 1913.\\nThe Einstein field equations are nonlinear and considered difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But in 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild\\'s solution to electrically charged objects were taken, eventually resulting in the Reissner–Nordström solution, which is now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.\\nDuring that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein showed in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (\"fudge factors\"), and in 1919 an expedition led by Eddington confirmed general relativity\\'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919, instantly making Einstein famous. Yet the theory remained outside the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics until developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the golden age of general relativity. Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects\\' astrophysical manifestations. Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory\\'s predictive power, and relativistic cosmology also became amenable to direct observational tests.\\nGeneral relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar has noted that at multiple levels, general relativity exhibits what Francis Bacon has termed a \"strangeness in the proportion\" (i.e. elements that excite wonderment and surprise). It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time versus matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein\\'s only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory. Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity and symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.\\nIn the preface to Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, Einstein said \"The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics. The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated.\"\\n\\n\\n== From classical mechanics to general relativity ==\\nGeneral relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton\\'s law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.\\n\\n\\n=== Geometry of Newtonian gravity ===\\n\\nAt the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body\\'s motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton\\'s second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body\\'s (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.\\nConversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton\\'s law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein\\'s elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in an enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is stationary in a gravitational field and the ball accelerating, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field versus the ball which upon release has nil acceleration.\\nGiven the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry. However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle\\'s velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle\\'s trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system. In this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.\\n\\n\\n=== Relativistic generalization ===\\n\\nAs intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations, boosts and reflections.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.\\nWith Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the spacetime\\'s semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.\\nSpecial relativity is defined in the absence of gravity. For practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall motion, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.\\nA priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.\\nThe same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).\\n\\n\\n=== Einstein\\'s equations ===\\n\\nHaving formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity\\'s source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energy–momentum tensor, which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress: pressure and shear. Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor, which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, conservation of energy–momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy–momentum tensor is divergence-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-manifold counterparts, covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition—the covariant divergence of the energy–momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero—the simplest nontrivial set of equations are what are called Einstein\\'s (field) equations:\\n\\nOn the left-hand side is the Einstein tensor, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          G\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle G_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\n  \\n, which is symmetric and a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          R\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle R_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\n  \\n and the metric.

The third term represents the relativistic effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Alternatives to general relativity ===\\n\\nThere are alternatives to general relativity built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. Examples are Whitehead\\'s theory, Brans–Dicke theory, teleparallelism, f(R) gravity and Einstein–Cartan theory.\\n\\n\\n== Definition and basic applications ==\\n\\nThe derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.\\n\\n\\n=== Definition and basic properties ===\\nGeneral relativity is a metric theory of gravitation. At its core are Einstein\\'s equations, which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\\nWhile general relativity replaces the scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank-two tensor, the latter reduces to the former in certain limiting cases. For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light, the theory\\'s predictions converge on those of Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation.\\nAs it is constructed using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take on the same form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that the laws of physics are the same for all observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.\\n\\n\\n=== Model-building ===\\nThe core concept of general-relativistic model-building is that of a solution of Einstein\\'s equations. Given both Einstein\\'s equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein\\'s equations, so in particular, the matter\\'s energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.\\nEinstein\\'s equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, a number of exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub–NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).\\nGiven the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein\\'s field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of numerical relativity, powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein\\'s equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes. In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities. Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity and its generalization, the post-Newtonian expansion, both of which were developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton\\'s theory due to general relativity. An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.\\n\\n\\n== Consequences of Einstein\\'s theory ==\\nGeneral relativity has a number of physical consequences. Some follow directly from the theory\\'s axioms, whereas others have become clear only in the course of many years of research that followed Einstein\\'s initial publication.\\n\\n\\n=== Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift ===\\n\\nAssuming that the equivalence principle holds, gravity influences the passage of time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent in the opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.\\nGravitational redshift has been measured in the laboratory and using astronomical observations. Gravitational time dilation in the Earth\\'s gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as a side effect of the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.\\n\\n\\n=== Light deflection and gravitational time delay ===\\n\\nGeneral relativity predicts that the path of light will follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star. This effect was initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.\\nThis and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.\\nClosely related to light deflection is the Shapiro Time Delay, the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.\\n\\n\\n=== Gravitational waves ===\\n\\nPredicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein, there are gravitational waves: ripples in the metric of spacetime that propagate at the speed of light. These are one of several analogies between weak-field gravity and electromagnetism in that, they are analogous to electromagnetic waves. On 11 February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging.\\nThe simplest type of such a wave can be visualized by its action on a ring of freely floating particles. A sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic, rhythmic fashion (animated image to the right). Since Einstein\\'s equations are non-linear, arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition, making their description difficult. However, linear approximations of gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves that are expected to arrive here on Earth from far-off cosmic events, which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          10\\n          \\n            −\\n            21\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 10^{-21}}\\n  \\n or less. Data analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be Fourier decomposed.\\nSome exact solutions describe gravitational waves without any approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves. But for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, such as the merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently the only way to construct appropriate models.\\n\\n\\n=== Orbital effects and the relativity of direction ===\\n\\nGeneral relativity differs from classical mechanics in a number of predictions concerning orbiting bodies. It predicts an overall rotation (precession) of planetary orbits, as well as orbital decay caused by the emission of gravitational waves and effects related to the relativity of direction.\\n\\n\\n==== Precession of apsides ====\\n\\nIn general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the point of the orbiting body\\'s closest approach to the system\\'s center of mass) will precess; the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, the fact that his theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury\\'s anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.\\nThe effect can also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass) or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism. It is due to the influence of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body\\'s gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein\\'s equations). Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.\\nIn general relativity the perihelion shift \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        σ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma }\\n  \\n, expressed in radians per revolution, is approximately given by\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        σ\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              24\\n              \\n                π\\n                \\n                  3\\n                \\n              \\n              \\n                L\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            \\n              \\n                T\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              \\n                c\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              (\\n              1\\n              −\\n              \\n                e\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n         \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma ={\\\\frac {24\\\\pi ^{3}L^{2}}{T^{2}c^{2}(1-e^{2})}}\\\\ ,}\\n  \\n\\nwhere:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        L\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle L}\\n  \\n is the semi-major axis\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        T\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle T}\\n  \\n is the orbital period\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c}\\n  \\n is the speed of light in vacuum\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        e\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle e}\\n  \\n is the orbital eccentricity\\n\\n\\n==== Orbital decay ====\\n\\nAccording to general relativity, a binary system will emit gravitational waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, the distance between the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.\\nThe first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor, using the binary pulsar PSR1913+16 they had discovered in 1974. This was the first detection of gravitational waves, albeit indirect, for which they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. Since then, several other binary pulsars have been found, in particular the double pulsar PSR J0737−3039, where both stars are pulsars and which was last reported to also be in agreement with general relativity in 2021 after 16 years of observations.\\n\\n\\n==== Geodetic precession and frame-dragging ====\\n\\nSeveral relativistic effects are directly related to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible (\"parallel transport\"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.\\nNear a rotating mass, there are gravitomagnetic or frame-dragging effects. A distant observer will determine that objects close to the mass get \"dragged around\". This is most extreme for rotating black holes where, for any object entering a zone known as the ergosphere, rotation is inevitable. Such effects can again be tested through their influence on the orientation of gyroscopes in free fall. Somewhat controversial tests have been performed using the LAGEOS satellites, confirming the relativistic prediction. Also the Mars Global Surveyor probe around Mars has been used.\\n\\n\\n== Interpretations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Neo-Lorentzian Interpretation ===\\n\\nExamples of physicists who support neo-Lorentzian explanations of general relativity are Franco Selleri and Antony Valentini.\\n\\n\\n== Astrophysical applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Gravitational lensing ===\\n\\nThe deflection of light by gravity is responsible for a new class of astronomical phenomena. If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target. Such effects are known as gravitational lensing. Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, there can be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.\\nThe earliest example was discovered in 1979; since then, more than a hundred gravitational lenses have been observed. Even if the multiple images are too close to each other to be resolved, the effect can still be measured, e.g., as an overall brightening of the target object; a number of such \"microlensing events\" have been observed.\\nGravitational lensing has developed into a tool of observational astronomy. It is used to detect the presence and distribution of dark matter, provide a \"natural telescope\" for observing distant galaxies, and to obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant. Statistical evaluations of lensing data provide valuable insight into the structural evolution of galaxies.\\n\\n\\n=== Gravitational-wave astronomy ===\\n\\nObservations of binary pulsars provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.\\nObservations of gravitational waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are expected to yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes in the very early universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger.\\n\\n\\n=== Black holes and other compact objects ===\\n\\nWhenever the ratio of an object\\'s mass to its radius becomes sufficiently large, general relativity predicts the formation of a black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses, are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars. Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have played an important role in the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.\\nAstronomically, the most important property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, is thought to be responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.\\nGeneral relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena, and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory.\\nBlack holes are also sought-after targets in the search for gravitational waves (cf. Gravitational waves, above). Merging black hole binaries should lead to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals reaching detectors here on Earth, and the phase directly before the merger (\"chirp\") could be used as a \"standard candle\" to deduce the distance to the merger events–and hence serve as a probe of cosmic expansion at large distances. The gravitational waves produced as a stellar black hole plunges into a supermassive one should provide direct information about the supermassive black hole\\'s geometry.\\n\\n\\n=== Cosmology ===\\n\\nThe current models of cosmology are based on Einstein\\'s field equations, which include the cosmological constant \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Λ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Lambda }\\n  \\n since it has important influence on the large-scale dynamics of the cosmos,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          R\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n        −\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              1\\n            \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        R\\n        \\n        \\n          g\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        Λ\\n         \\n        \\n          g\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              8\\n              π\\n              G\\n            \\n            \\n              c\\n              \\n                4\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          T\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle R_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }-{\\\\textstyle 1 \\\\over 2}R\\\\,g_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }+\\\\Lambda \\\\ g_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }={\\\\frac {8\\\\pi G}{c^{4}}}\\\\,T_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\n  \\n\\nwhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          g\\n          \\n            μ\\n            ν\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle g_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\n  \\n is the spacetime metric. Isotropic and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations, the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solutions, allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14 billion years from a hot, early Big Bang phase. Once a small number of parameters (for example the universe\\'s mean matter density) have been fixed by astronomical observation, further observational data can be used to put the models to the test. Predictions, all successful, include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the existence and properties of a \"thermal echo\" from the early cosmos, the cosmic background radiation.\\nAstronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.\\nAn inflationary phase, an additional phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 to account for several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).\\n\\n\\n=== Exotic solutions: time travel, warp drives ===\\nKurt Gödel showed that solutions to Einstein\\'s equations exist that contain closed timelike curves (CTCs), which allow for loops in time. The solutions require extreme physical conditions unlikely ever to occur in practice, and it remains an open question whether further laws of physics will eliminate them completely. Since then, other—similarly impractical—GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and traversable wormholes. Stephen Hawking introduced chronology protection conjecture, which is an assumption beyond those of standard general relativity to prevent time travel.\\nSome exact solutions in general relativity such as Alcubierre drive present examples of warp drive but these solutions requires exotic matter distribution, and generally suffers from semiclassical instability.\\n\\n\\n== Advanced concepts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Asymptotic symmetries ===\\n\\nThe spacetime symmetry group for special relativity is the Poincaré group, which is a ten-dimensional group of three Lorentz boosts, three rotations, and four spacetime translations. It is logical to ask what symmetries if any might apply in General Relativity. A tractable case might be to consider the symmetries of spacetime as seen by observers located far away from all sources of the gravitational field. The naive expectation for asymptotically flat spacetime symmetries might be simply to extend and reproduce the symmetries of flat spacetime of special relativity, viz., the Poincaré group.\\nIn 1962 Hermann Bondi, M. G. van der Burg, A. W. Metzner and Rainer K. Sachs addressed this asymptotic symmetry problem in order to investigate the flow of energy at infinity due to propagating gravitational waves. Their first step was to decide on some physically sensible boundary conditions to place on the gravitational field at light-like infinity to characterize what it means to say a metric is asymptotically flat, making no a priori assumptions about the nature of the asymptotic symmetry group—not even the assumption that such a group exists. Then after designing what they considered to be the most sensible boundary conditions, they investigated the nature of the resulting asymptotic symmetry transformations that leave invariant the form of the boundary conditions appropriate for asymptotically flat gravitational fields. What they found was that the asymptotic symmetry transformations actually do form a group and the structure of this group does not depend on the particular gravitational field that happens to be present. This means that, as expected, one can separate the kinematics of spacetime from the dynamics of the gravitational field at least at spatial infinity. The puzzling surprise in 1962 was their discovery of a rich infinite-dimensional group (the so-called BMS group) as the asymptotic symmetry group, instead of the finite-dimensional Poincaré group, which is a subgroup of the BMS group. Not only are the Lorentz transformations asymptotic symmetry transformations, there are also additional transformations that are not Lorentz transformations but are asymptotic symmetry transformations. In fact, they found an additional infinity of transformation generators known as supertranslations. This implies the conclusion that General Relativity (GR) does not reduce to special relativity in the case of weak fields at long distances. It turns out that the BMS symmetry, suitably modified, could be seen as a restatement of the universal soft graviton theorem in quantum field theory (QFT), which relates universal infrared (soft) QFT with GR asymptotic spacetime symmetries.\\n\\n\\n=== Causal structure and global geometry ===\\n\\nIn general relativity, no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime\\'s causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk (\"compactified\") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.\\nAware of the importance of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein\\'s equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.\\n\\n\\n=== Horizons ===\\n\\nUsing global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called horizons, which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole\\'s horizon, is not a physical barrier.\\n\\nEarly studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein\\'s equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a static black hole) and the axisymmetric Kerr solution (used to describe a rotating, stationary black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. With time they become rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying: electric charge, mass–energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and location at a specified time. This is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorem: \"black holes have no hair\", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.\\nEven more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for the black hole area to decrease as long as other processes ensure that entropy increases overall. As thermodynamical objects with nonzero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semiclassical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck\\'s law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).\\nThere are many other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (\"particle horizon\"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon). Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer (Rindler space), there will be horizons associated with a semiclassical radiation known as Unruh radiation.\\n\\n\\n=== Singularities ===\\n\\nAnother general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities. Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics—all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein\\'s equations have \"ragged edges\"—regions known as spacetime singularities, where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are \"curvature singularities\", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the Ricci scalar, take on infinite values. Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities—where worldlines end—are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole, or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole. The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities (Big Crunch) as well.\\nGiven that these examples are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities\\' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.\\n\\n\\n=== Evolution equations ===\\n\\nEach solution of Einstein\\'s equation encompasses the whole history of a universe—it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein\\'s theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.\\nTo understand Einstein\\'s equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in \"3+1\" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the ADM formalism. These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always exist, and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified. Such formulations of Einstein\\'s field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.\\n\\n\\n=== Global and quasi-local quantities ===\\n\\nThe notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. In Einstein\\'s theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system\\'s total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.\\nNevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system\\'s total mass, either using a hypothetical \"infinitely distant observer\" (ADM mass) or suitable symmetries (Komar mass). If one excludes from the system\\'s total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the Bondi mass at null infinity. Just as in classical physics, it can be shown that these masses are positive. Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum. There have also been a number of attempts to define quasi-local quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system. The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about isolated systems, such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture.\\n\\n\\n== Relationship with quantum theory ==\\nIf general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid-state physics, would be the other. However, how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question.\\n\\n\\n=== Quantum field theory in curved spacetime ===\\n\\nOrdinary quantum field theories, which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.\\n\\n\\n=== Quantum gravity ===\\n\\nThe demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime, as well as the appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics. Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.\\nAttempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, so as to include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power (\"perturbative non-renormalizability\").\\n\\nOne attempt to overcome these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.\\nAnother approach starts with the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), the result is the Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.\\nDepending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts to arrive at a viable theory of quantum gravity, some examples being the lattice theory of gravity based on the Feynman Path Integral approach and Regge calculus, dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path integral based models of quantum cosmology.\\n\\nAll candidate theories still have major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.\\n\\n\\n== Current status ==\\nGeneral relativity has emerged as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications that the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics.\\nEven taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek to understand the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein\\'s equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on 14 September 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAlcubierre drive – Hypothetical FTL transportation by warping space (warp drive)\\nAlternatives to general relativity – Proposed theories of gravity\\nContributors to general relativity\\nDerivations of the Lorentz transformations\\nEhrenfest paradox – Paradox in special relativity\\nEinstein–Hilbert action – Concept in general relativity\\nEinstein\\'s thought experiments – Albert Einstein\\'s hypothetical situations to argue scientific points\\nGeneral relativity priority dispute – Debate about credit for general relativity\\nIntroduction to the mathematics of general relativity – non-technical introduction to the mathematics of general relativityPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\\nNordström\\'s theory of gravitation – Predecessor to the theory of relativity\\nRicci calculus – Tensor index notation for tensor-based calculations\\nTimeline of gravitational physics and relativity\\nWeak Gravity Conjecture – Conjecture that gravity must be the weakest forcePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n=== Popular books ===\\nEinstein, A.
