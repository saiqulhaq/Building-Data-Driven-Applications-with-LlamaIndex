**A practical guide to retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for Enhancing LLM Applications**

## What is this book about?
Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) possess immense potential. These models simplify problems but have limitations, including contextual memory constraints, prompt size issues, real-time data gaps, and occasional "hallucinations."

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the LlamaIndex ecosystem and common use cases
* Master techniques to ingest and parse data from various sources into LlamaIndex
* Discover how to create optimized indexes tailored to your use cases
* Understand how to query LlamaIndex effectively and interpret responses
* Build an end-to-end interactive web application with LlamaIndex, Python and, Streamlit
* Customize a LlamaIndex configuration based on your project needs
* Predict costs and deal with potential privacy issues
* Deploy LlamaIndex applications that others can use
